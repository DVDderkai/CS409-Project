## 💡 Tips

1. **Start testing early** - Fix bugs before deployment
2. **Create prototypes soon** - Give yourself time to refine before presentation
3. **Practice presentation** - Be ready to present smoothly in class
4. **Test deployment early** - Deploy as soon as possible to catch issues
5. **Record video multiple times** - Practice makes perfect
6. **Backup everything** - Keep copies of important files
